-- Now we create the "block membership" table, which has a row for each census block and contains 
-- its id, its population, its geometry, as well as booleans that indicate whether it is 
-- in the service area, near a base service stop, near a stop that receives frequent service, and
-- whether it is "high density" (meaning contains more than 7000 people per square mile)

-- It requires that data on Massachusetts census blocks be loaded into a table called "census."
